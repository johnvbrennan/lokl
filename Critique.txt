It sounds like an exciting project! Since I can't "see" your current UI files or screenshots, I will provide a structured critique based on the standard conventions and pain points found in map-based games like *GeoGuessr* or *City Guesser*.

Effective UI for a geography game needs to balance two conflicting modes: **Exploration** (looking at the world) and **Deduction** (using the map).

## 1. Spatial Efficiency & HUD Layout

The biggest mistake in map games is "UI Crowding." Your primary "content" is the location itself; the UI should be a transparent layer over it.

* **The "Collapsible" Map:** In most successful games, the guess-map is a small overlay in the corner that expands on hover or click.
* *Critique Tip:* If your guess-map is always large, it blocks the player's view of the environment. Use a "Mini-to-Maxi" transition.


* **Safe Zones:** Keep vital stats (Score, Round 1/5, Timer) in the corners. Avoid placing UI elements in the center-bottom, as this is where users often click to "move" or "look down" at the ground for license plate/soil clues.

## 2. Interaction Design (The "Guessing" Flow)

* **The "Confirm Guess" Button:** This should be high-contrast and only become active *after* a pin is dropped.
* **Visual Feedback Loops:** When a user drops a pin, do you show the distance immediately?
* *Enhancement:* Use a "Polyline" (a dotted line) connecting the actual location to the guessed location after the round ends. This provides instant spatial learning.


* **Hotkeys:** Power users hate moving their mouse across the whole screen.
* *Standard:* `Spacebar` to confirm guess, `R` to return to the start point (if it's a moving game).



## 3. Aesthetic & Thematic Consistency

The name **"Locle"** suggests a clean, perhaps Wordle-inspired, minimalist aesthetic.

* **Typography:** Use a highly legible Sans-Serif font. Avoid "gamey" or "grunge" fonts that make distance numbers () hard to read.
* **Color Palette:** Use a "Semantic Color" system:
* **Success:** Green (Close guesses).
* **Warning/Action:** Yellow/Orange (Timer running out).
* **Neutral:** Dark Mode UI (Translucent blacks/greys) works best for map games because it doesn't distract from the vibrant colors of the Street View/Photos.



## 4. Onboarding & Accessibility

* **The "Compass" Problem:** Many users don't realize which way is North. Ensure your compass is visible but doesn't obscure the "Back to Start" button.
* **Colorblind Mode:** Red/Green colorblindness is common. If you use a heat-map or color-coded pins for accuracy, provide a "High Contrast" or "Shape-Based" alternative (e.g., a Star for the correct spot, a Circle for the guess).

### Comparison Table: Minimalist vs. Data-Rich UI

| Feature | Minimalist (Wordle-style) | Competitive (Pro-style) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Map State** | Hidden until clicked | Persistent mini-map |
| **Timer** | Simple progress bar | Digital countdown with "pulse" |
| **Post-Game** | Shareable emoji grid | Detailed XP and Rank breakdown |
| **Controls** | Click/Touch only | Full Hotkey support |
